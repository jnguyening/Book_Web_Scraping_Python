# Web Scraping Book Data from Books to Scrape (Python)

## Project Overview

This project uses **Python** to scrape book data from the website [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/), a site designed for practicing web scraping techniques. The scraper collects details such as book titles, prices, availability, ratings, and categories. The goal is to demonstrate how to extract structured data from HTML using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, turning a static website into a usable dataset for analysis or automation.
